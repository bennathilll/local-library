# Local Library

The neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

The dashboard shows General Stats, Most Common Genres, Most Popular Books and Most Popular Authors.
